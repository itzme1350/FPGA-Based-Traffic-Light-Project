Material and Equipements
•	BASYS 3 FPGA Development Board
•	Breadboard
•	LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
•	220Ω Resistors (6 units)
•	Connecting Wires
•	Computer with Xilinx Vivado Design Suite
•	Multimeter (for voltage measurement)

This project involves using Finite State Machines (FSM) to control the traffic lights. The FSM cycles through states representing green, yellow, and red lights for each traffic direction based on a timing sequence. The FPGA's programmable logic pins control the LEDs based on the synthesized Verilog code.
